## Overview
The objective of this project is to design a lane detection (with lane turn signal and
drive heading output) system for autonomous vehicles/Robots. The proposed lane
detection algorithm by using a video feed input of a vehicle driving on the highway,
will detect the lane position and give drive heading angle. Which in turn can be
passed to steering control system to move the vehicle inside the lane. Maintaining
the lane on highway is very critical for autonomics vehicles. With the growing research
and development in the field of autonomous driving, this system will certainly
provide Acme Robotics competitive edge over competitors. The system can be also
be integrated with the popular Lane departure warning system designed to warn the
driver when the vehicle begins to move out of its lane. The system being developed
in C++ language will provide very good real time performance.
